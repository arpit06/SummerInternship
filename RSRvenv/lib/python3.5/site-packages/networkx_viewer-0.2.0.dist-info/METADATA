NetworkX Viewer provides a basic interactive GUI to view
`networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ graphs.  In addition to standard
plotting and layout features as found natively in networkx, the GUI allows
you to:

  - Drag nodes around to tune the default layout
  - Show and hide nodes
  - Filter nodes
  - Pan and zoom
  - Display nodes only within a certain number of hops ("levels") of
    a "home node"
  - Display and highlight the shortest path between two nodes.  Nodes
    around the path can also be displayed within a settable number of
    levels
  - Intelligently find and display nodes near displayed nodes using
    "Grow" and "Grow Until" functions
  - Use attributes stored in the graph's node and edge dictionaries to
    customize the appearance of the node and edge tokens in the GUI
  - Mark nodes and edges for reference
  - Support for both `nx.Graph` and `nx.MultiGraph`
